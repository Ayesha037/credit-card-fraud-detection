# Credit Card Fraud Detection

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using data analysis, machine learning, and SQL-based insights.  
The goal is to identify fraud accurately while handling highly imbalanced transaction data.

---

##  Problem Statement
Credit card fraud is rare but extremely costly.  
The main challenge is:
- Fraud transactions are very few compared to normal ones
- Accuracy alone is misleading
- We must focus on catching fraud without blocking genuine users

---

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset
- Contains anonymized transaction features
- Highly imbalanced dataset (fraud ≪ normal transactions)

---

##  Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – machine learning model
- **SQL** – fraud pattern analysis
- **Git & GitHub** – version control

##  What I Did in This Project

###  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed class imbalance between fraud and non-fraud transactions
- Studied transaction amount distribution
- Visualized correlations between features
- Identified time-based fraud patterns

###  Feature Analysis
- Checked feature importance
- Understood which variables contribute most to fraud detection

###  Machine Learning Model
- Trained a classification model to detect fraud
- Evaluated using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision & Recall
  - ROC and Precision-Recall curves

###  SQL-Based Analysis
- Wrote SQL queries to:
  - Identify suspicious transactions
  - Analyze fraud by time and amount
  - Support business-level fraud investigation

##  Visual Outputs
The project includes multiple visualizations:
- Class distribution
- Transaction amount distribution
- Correlation heatmap
- Confusion matrix
- ROC & PR curves
- Feature importance charts

---

##  Key Learnings
- Handling imbalanced datasets is critical in fraud detection
- Accuracy alone is not enough; recall and precision matter more
- Combining ML with SQL provides better business insights
- Data visualization helps explain fraud patterns clearly

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end fraud detection workflow combining data analysis, machine learning, and SQL.  
It reflects a practical, business-oriented approach to solving real-world financial problems.
